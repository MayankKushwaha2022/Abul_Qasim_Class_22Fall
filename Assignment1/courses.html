            <h4>Level:1</h4>
            <h5>Course Code: MAT8001C</h5>
            <p>The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an essential prerequisite to Calculus. Students
                manipulate algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear systems and learn the properties
                of and graph algebraic and transcendental functions. Students investigate computer number systems in
                addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems. Students also
                study the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components. Delivered in a modular format,
                this course is equivalent to the completion of all of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D,
                E, F, and L.</p>

            <p>Rapid changes in technology have created personal and employment choices that challenge each of us to
                find our place as contributing citizens in the emerging society. Life in the 21st century presents
                significant opportunities, but it also creates potential hazards and ethical problems that demand
                responsible solutions. Students explore the possibilities ahead, assess their own aptitudes and
                strengths, and apply critical thinking and decision-making tools to help resolve some of the important
                issues in our complex society with its competing interests.</p>

            <p>Operating systems form the backbone of information technology systems coordinating the interaction
                between hardware and software. Students explore the basic concepts and components of Operating Systems
                (OS), and how they function and interact with hardware and software components. Students examine the
                details of operating system structures, process management, storage management, installation,
                configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical assignments based on the

            <p>The rapid growth of the global economy raises fundamental questions: How do trade and politics affect
                development and the environment? What are the effects of free trade and the rise of multi-national
                corporations on local cultures? What are the effects of the "clash of cultures" produced by
                international travel, migration, and new social, collaborative technologies that send film, books,
                television, music and other "proprietary" content spinning around the world instantly? Is globalization
                environmentally sustainable? Students examine these and other questions and analyze the day-to-day
                choices raised by globalization in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
